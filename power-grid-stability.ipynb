Another particularly important method is the update_power_grid() method where the step function appears. This method changes the demand of the cities with a sine wave and a randomize (controlled) demand, then it draws power from the generator and neighbouring nodes if it doesn't have enough. "

    "Unfortunatly, the team was not able to get the consume_from_neighbours() function works correctly as it is complex and very intricate, involving multiple layers. Under the condition of only one node need help from its neighbour, the method works fine. However, when there are more than one city node demand help, its impact is too large and eventually breaks the simulation. However, an attempt at making the simulation to be \"single-source\" was made in a separate source file simulating the implementation of a single point source microgrid and how it distribute power effectively within its nodes. That said, by running the code below, the graphs will be drawn and demonstrates the current work of the team."
